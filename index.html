                Personal Information
              </h1>
                <p>
                  Born in Australia and lived in Far North Queensland all my life!
                  I completed high school back in 2008 and since then (other than a brief stint as a first year engineering student before the birth of my first daughter) I have only studied at the school of life! I speak only English. I own and run a mushroom farm up here in FNQ and have 3 daughters under 8, so I am kept quite busy. We grow several kinds of exotic mushrooms on our farm including Shiitake, Oyster, and Lion’s Mane mushroom. I love learning and I spend almost every working hour with a podcast or audiobook of some sort in my ears.

                Interest in IT
              </h1>
              <p>
                I have always had a keen interest in IT, and fascination with technology in general. I grew up on a Dairy Farm and I was definitely one of those classic kids who enjoyed taking things apart and totally failing to put them together again. In 2006 after Cyclone Larry hit our family farm and we were left without power for a number of weeks, we had to repurpose many things to keep things running and make sure the cows could be milked. An old tractor became the heart of our system, with a 12 volt line tapped to the alternator to run milk pumps, sensors and pulsators, and some old pvc piping hooked directly to the tractor’s air intake to serve in place of a vacuum pump. This was a very formative experience for me and as a result I particularly enjoyed hacky/tinkering projects which had some overlap between hardware and software. I also really enjoy work that involves repurposing tech to do things which it was never meant to do, or extending its usability and efficiency in the task it was designed for.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have always toyed with IT and programming in a very rudimentary sense, always to the extent of cobbling together enough code or IT knowledge to get something working and then moving on, but have never undertaken any formal study until now.  In recent years I have developed a sharper interest in AI generally, and machine learning specifically and am unbelievably excited about the prospects of ML as an applicable tool to so many industries. This spurred me on to take on formal study, and after searching around for some time I settled on this RMIT course as a great starting point to dip my toes into the academic world of IT. RMIT seems to be very highly regarded in the IT field in terms of hireability of graduates, but also has a reputation for ‘above world standard’ research in the AI & ML space.
                In this course I expect to gain a wider and deeper understanding of the field of IT and test my mettle in the area of academic study, perhaps developing other areas of interest as I go along.

                Staff Engineer, Machine Learning
              </h2>

              <p>
                This staff engineer position involves taking a lead role in design and building of new machine learning systems for novel applications in the small to medium enterprise sector. It is a position with a lot of freedom to explore machine learning technologies and find appropriate fits for these, but still involves ground level work of building, optimising, and maintaining these systems. The balance of both is appealing, as I feel it is important to innovate and dream up new uses for tech as it becomes available, as well as being able to have concrete and fundamental skills that are useful day to day. The interplay between the two helps both sides and I feel my personality and working style mean that I would thrive with exposure to (and sometimes constraint to) both sides of this coin.
              </p>
              <p>
                The position requires a high level knowledge of an applicable programming language in the space, like python or Scala. It also requires a deep working knowledge of cloud-native application systems and AWS, as well as being able to work with distributed data systems or streaming applications. Being a full stack engineer is a necessity as the role requires being able to dive into any level for debugging, improving or maintaining any element. It is also necessary to have this comfortability with the whole stack so that concise roadmaps can be drawn between the data and the insights we hope to gain. Being able to communicate well in all formats is a necessity, as is the case in almost all modern work, as these ‘soft skills’ tie every team and project together. These skills are particularly applicable here, working at many levels means not just communicating with IT professionals, but gaining insights from consumers about customer facing elements as well.
              </p>

            <p>
              To be well suited for this role I would need to build on a small amount of programming knowledge I have now, particularly in python to develop expert level skills and knowledge of the language and libraries applicable to machine learning. I would need to complete specific machine learning study such as a Master of Artificial intelligence with RMIT. Involvement with projects that utilise AWS and cloud-native application architectures would also help prepare for a position like this. Constant awareness of, and improvement on my communication skills in a professional setting would also be important.

                  Interpreting Results
                </h1>
                <p>
                   The combined results of these personality tests indicate that I am an overly optimistic people pleaser. I am eager to pursue projects I am passionate about, but particularly to benefit other people and feel their appreciation for my efforts. I am an extrovert in many senses and always seeking other people to share my excitement and passion. I am relatively level headed and hard to upset, happy to engage with others, and always seeking a deeper connection or deeper meaning to the things I’m applying myself to. Generally open to new ideas or approaches, and easily interested in many topics, potentially to my detriment when putting energy in multiple directions at once or biting off more than I can chew. My learning style indicates a rationality and need to fit things to a system or model, so new ideas are readily assimilated and connected to my existing systems of thinking. These personality tests do provide very interesting insights into my personality and are potentially useful tools to better understand myself and avoid weaknesses. But they are not necessarily an accurate summary of a complete person, nor of their potential for adaptation.
                   In a team I am likely to try to connect personally with everyone on the team, and seek as much varied input from everyone as possible. I am likely to either align behind a particular person or idea and work passionately and energetically to serve that idea or person as best I can, or find myself as the energetic lead of a project. I am likely to defend my own ideas passionately but avoid conflict at all costs and readily take on the ideas of others if I am wrong. When the initial excitement of a project fades, I am likely to need to look to others as my reason for continuing to work passionately on the project.
                </p>
                                <p>
                  When forming a team I will generally fit well into any group, but will thrive in an environment where shared excitement and passion is passed freely and communication is good. In a conflict heavy environment I am likely to retreat, or put far too much energy into trying to resolve situations and make sure everyone feels happy. I would fit well with other personalities that take the lead as I will happily direct my energy to seeing their ideas come to fruition, but I will also work well in a leadership role with personalities that like to build together as passionate equals.

                    Project Idea
                  </h1>
                  <h2>
                    Overview
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                  The proposed project is a control system to adjust the weight of mushroom bags as they are being filled. The control system will be attached to a substrate mixer to automate the opening and closing of a chute as the system receives weight inputs. This will adjust the substrate output and keep bag weights within an acceptable range. The system will also need to account for a delay between the open or close action and the substrate being extruded to the bags.
                  </p>
                  <h2>
                    Motivation
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    Mushroom yield is significantly affected by the size of the substrate block that is produced. Rashid et al. (2007) suggest that oversized mushroom blocks will limit yields and undersized blocks do not make efficient use of bagging costs.
                    I operate a mushroom farm where we produce 1000 bags of mushroom substrate each week. Our current bagging system requires a person to be available to adjust the substrate flow from a chute every few minutes to keep the bag weight within an optimal range. This means that they must leave the station they are working at, walk to the other end of the shed and adjust the flow. The substrate takes over a minute to reach the bagging machine, so adjustments take a long time to be observed. This means a frequent ‘pendulum effect’ with weights being adjusted multiple times in one direction before realising the adjustment has gone too far and needs to be partially reversed. Automating this adjustment would mean a significant time saving in walking time, and time spent manually adjusting over or underweight bags.
                  </p>
                  <h2>
                    Description
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    This project would incorporate a software control system to take input from a user in the form of a target weight at the start of operation. It would also regularly take weight data inputs, compare the input weight to the target weight, and send signals to an adjustment mechanism to open or close the chute accordingly, and change the substrate output of the mixer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A simple user interface will handle the target weight input, provide button options for manually incrementing an open or close action. It will also have a simple start/stop so adjustment can be isolated if needed. The regular weight inputs will come from a load cell onto which mushroom bags will be placed as they are removed from the bagging machine. For every weight input the system will compare to the target weight and send adjustment signals. Larger deviations from the target weight will require larger adjustments, and if the mushroom bags are close enough to the target weight, no adjustment will be made, as small variations in flow could mean constant adjustment signals and unnecessary wear on the adjustment mechanism. After the appropriate adjustment is calculated it will be sent the adjustment mechanism. The adjustment mechanism will be a reversible gear motor attached to a screw drive, to force the chute open or closed as the motor rotates.
                    The adjusted substrate amount will travel through the system and be bagged and placed onto the load cell providing the input for the next adjustment.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The control system will be centred around a Raspberry Pi running a version of ROS (Robot Operating System). Within ROS all software will be written in python (Thank you Intro to Programming) This Rpi will be directly interfaced with over wifi by way of an android phone using ROS android interface tools. This is where target weight will be input, and other interface buttons will reside. The weight inputs will come from a 5kg load cell, and a weight sensor to convert this input to a readable form for the Raspberry Pi. The adjustment mechanism will be a small 12 volt gear motor with an ACME screw and hub nut attached to the chute, and will be connected to a motor controller to allow it to be controlled directly by the Raspberry Pi.
                  </p>
                  <h2>
                    Skills required
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    Knowledge of ROS and Python on the Raspberry Pi will be essential. I am currently studying Intro to programming where we are working with Python, and ROS is an open source project with extensive modules and documentation readily available (ROS.rog). All hardware is readily available online and I have all the necessary components already, from other project
                  </p>
                  <h2>
                    Outcome
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    If the project is successful there will be no need for manual adjustment of mushroom chutes. It will no longer be necessary to stop other jobs to make adjustments, and a lot of time will be saved in adjusting oversized or undersized bags. I estimate this will save us 1 hour per bagging run (approximately 3 hours per week). Consistent bag size will lead to consistent yield, and a more productive farm!
